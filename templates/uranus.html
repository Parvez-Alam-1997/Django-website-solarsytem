URANUS
{%endblock name%}

{%block des1%}
Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun in our solar system and is classified as an ice giant.

Size and Composition
{%endblock head1%}
              
{%block content1%}
Uranus has a diameter of about 51,118 kilometers (31,763 miles), making it the third-largest planet in our solar system. It is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, along with traces of methane, water, and ammonia. The presence of methane in its atmosphere gives Uranus its distinctive blue-green color.

Rotation and Tilt
{%endblock head2%}
              
{%block content2%}
Uranus rotates on its side, with an axial tilt of about 98 degrees. This extreme tilt is responsible for the planet's unusual seasonal variations. Unlike most planets, Uranus rotates from top to bottom rather than from side to side.

{%block head3%} 
Atmosphere
{%endblock head3%}
              
{%block content3%}
Uranus has a thick atmosphere that contains methane, which gives the planet its blue-green hue. The atmosphere also includes other gases, such as hydrogen and helium. Clouds and storms are present in the atmosphere, but detailed observations are challenging due to the lack of direct imaging.

{%block head4%} 
Rings
{%endblock head4%}
              
{%block content4%}
Uranus has a system of faint and narrow rings, which were first discovered in 1977 by astronomers using a telescope. Unlike the more prominent rings of Saturn, Uranus' rings are dark and composed of small particles, likely a mixture of water ice and dark, organic material.

Moons
{%endblock head5%}
              
{%block content5%}
Uranus has 27 known moons, and they are named after characters from the works of William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope. The largest moon, Titania, is the eighth-largest moon in the solar system. Another notable moon is Miranda, known for its varied and unusual terrain.

Space Missions
{%endblock head6%}
              
{%block content6%}
Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to have visited Uranus. It conducted a flyby of the planet in 1986, providing valuable data about its atmosphere, rings, and moons. No future missions to Uranus have been planned as of my knowledge cutoff in January 2022.

{%block head7%} 
Magnetic Field
{%endblock head7%}
              
{%block content7%}
Uranus has a unique magnetic field that is tilted at a significant angle relative to its rotation axis. This unusual magnetic field suggests complex interactions between the planet's interior and its surrounding environment.

{%block head8%} 
Temperature and Conditions
{%endblock head8%}
              
{%block content8%}
Uranus is a cold planet, with temperatures dropping as low as -224 degrees Celsius (-371 degrees Fahrenheit). The extreme axial tilt causes one pole to face the Sun for an extended period during its 84-year orbit, resulting in extreme seasonal variations.

{%block des2%} 
Uranus remains a relatively mysterious and less-explored planet in our solar system. Its unique characteristics, such as its sideways rotation and peculiar magnetic field, make it an interesting subject for further study and exploration.
