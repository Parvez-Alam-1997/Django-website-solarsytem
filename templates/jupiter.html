Size and Composition
{%endblock head1%}
              
{%block content1%}
Jupiter is a gas giant with a diameter of about 139,822 kilometers (86,881 miles), making it more than 11 times wider than Earth. It is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of other elements.

Atmosphere
{%endblock head2%}
              
{%block content2%}
Jupiter's thick atmosphere is characterized by bands of clouds, including the iconic Great Red Spot—a massive storm that has been raging for centuries. The atmosphere also contains other storms, lightning, and a variety of cloud types.

Magnetosphere
{%endblock head3%}
              
{%block content3%}
Jupiter has a powerful magnetic field, the strongest in our solar system. This magnetic field creates intense radiation belts, making the environment around Jupiter inhospitable for spacecraft and posing challenges for exploration.

Moons
{%endblock head4%}
              
{%block content4%}
Jupiter has a large number of moons, with over 80 known satellites. The four largest moons—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, known as the Galilean moons—were discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. These moons are diverse, with Io having active volcanoes, Europa having an ice-covered ocean, and Ganymede being the largest moon in the solar system.

Great Red Spot
{%endblock head5%}
              
{%block content5%}
The Great Red Spot is a massive anticyclonic storm in Jupiter's atmosphere. It has been observed since the 17th century and is estimated to be about twice the diameter of Earth. Despite its name, the color and exact nature of the Great Red Spot are still not fully understood.

Rings
{%endblock head6%}
              
{%block content6%}
Jupiter has a faint ring system composed of small, dark particles. The ring system is not as prominent or well-defined as Saturn's rings.

{%block head7%} 
Rotation and Day
{%endblock head7%}
              
{%block content7%}
Jupiter has a rapid rotation, completing one full rotation on its axis in about 9.9 hours. This rapid rotation results in an equatorial bulge, making the planet slightly flattened at the poles.

Gravity and Mass
{%endblock head8%}
              
{%block content8%}
Jupiter has a strong gravitational pull, about 24.79 m/s² (meters per second squared), which is more than 24 times that of Earth. Its mass is approximately 318 times that of Earth.

Several space missions have been sent to study Jupiter, including Pioneer 10 and 11, Voyager 1 and 2, Galileo, and Juno. The Juno spacecraft, launched by NASA in 2011, has been studying Jupiter's atmosphere, magnetic field, and composition since entering orbit in 2016. Jupiter's immense size and unique features make it a fascinating subject of study for astronomers and planetary scientists. The planet's gravitational influence also plays a crucial role in the dynamics of the solar system.
