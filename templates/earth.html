Size and Composition
{%endblock head1%}
              
{%block content1%}
Earth has a diameter of about 12,742 kilometers (7,918 miles) and is composed mostly of rock and metal. It has a diverse and dynamic surface with continents, oceans, and an atmosphere.

Atmosphere
{%endblock head2%}
              
{%block content2%}
Earth's atmosphere is a mixture of gases, primarily nitrogen (about 78%) and oxygen (about 21%), with trace amounts of other gases. The atmosphere plays a crucial role in supporting life by regulating temperature, providing oxygen, and protecting against harmful solar radiation.

Water and Life
{%endblock head3%}
              
{%block content3%}
Earth is known as the "Blue Planet" because of its abundance of water. Oceans cover about 71% of the Earth's surface, and water is essential for life as we know it. The presence of liquid water sets Earth apart from other planets in our solar system. Earth is the only known planet to harbor life. The diversity of life forms, from microscopic bacteria to complex organisms, is sustained by the planet's unique combination of environmental conditions, including a suitable range of temperatures and the availability of water.

Climate and Weather
{%endblock head4%}

{%block content4%}
Earth experiences a variety of climates and weather patterns due to its axial tilt and rotation. These variations contribute to the planet's biodiversity and shape the ecosystems found across different regions.

{%block head5%} 
Magnetic Field
{%endblock head5%}
              
{%block content5%}
Earth has a magnetic field generated by its iron-nickel core. This magnetic field helps protect the planet's atmosphere from the solar wind, which is a stream of charged particles emanating from the Sun.

{%block head6%} 
Rotation and Orbit
{%endblock head6%}
              
{%block content6%}
Earth rotates on its axis, completing one full rotation approximately every 24 hours, leading to the cycle of day and night. The planet orbits the Sun in an elliptical path, completing one orbit roughly every 365.25 days, defining a year.

{%block head7%} 
Moon
{%endblock head7%}
              
{%block content7%}
Earth has a single natural satellite, the Moon, which plays a significant role in stabilizing the planet's axial tilt and influencing tides.

Space Exploration
{%endblock head8%}
              
{%block content8%}
Earth has been the starting point for human exploration into space. Satellites and spacecraft continuously observe and study Earth, providing valuable data on climate, weather, and various environmental factors.

{%block des2%} 
Understanding Earth is essential not only for the well-being of its inhabitants but also for gaining insights into the broader processes that govern planetary habitability and the potential for life beyond our solar system.
