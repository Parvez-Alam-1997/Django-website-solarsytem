SUN
{%endblock name%}

{%block des1%}
The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star, commonly referred to as a yellow dwarf. It is the central and most significant celestial body in our solar system, providing the primary source of light and energy that sustains life on Earth.

Composition
{%endblock head1%}
              
{%block content1%}
The Sun is primarily composed of hydrogen (about 74% by mass) and helium (about 24%). Other elements, such as oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, and trace amounts of other elements, make up the remaining percentage.

Structure
{%endblock head2%}
              
{%block content2%}
The Sun has several layers, including the core, radiative zone, convective zone, photosphere, chromosphere, and corona. The core is the region where nuclear fusion occurs, converting hydrogen into helium and releasing a tremendous amount of energy in the process.

Energy Production
{%endblock head3%}
              
{%block content3%}
The Sun's energy is generated through a process called nuclear fusion. In the core, hydrogen nuclei (protons) fuse to form helium, releasing energy in the form of light and heat. This energy takes thousands of years to reach the Sun's surface, where it is then radiated into space.

{%block head4%} 
Size and Mass
{%endblock head4%}
              
{%block content4%}
The Sun is about 109 times the diameter of Earth, and its mass is approximately 333,000 times that of Earth. Despite its enormous size, the Sun is considered an average-sized star.

{%block head5%} 
Surface Features
{%endblock head5%}
              
{%block content5%}
The Sun's surface, known as the photosphere, is marked by features such as sunspots, solar flares, and prominences. Sunspots are cooler, darker areas caused by magnetic activity, while solar flares are intense bursts of energy and light. Prominences are large, looping structures of hot, ionized gas that extend into the Sun's outer atmosphere.

{%block head6%} 
Solar Activity
{%endblock head6%}
              
{%block content6%}
The Sun goes through an approximately 11-year solar cycle, marked by variations in sunspot numbers and solar activity. The solar cycle influences space weather and can impact technologies like satellites and power grids on Earth.

{%block head7%} 
Solar Wind
{%endblock head7%}
              
{%block content7%}
The Sun constantly emits a stream of charged particles known as the solar wind. This flow of particles extends throughout the solar system and influences the space environment around planets.

{%block head8%} 
Age
{%endblock head8%}
              
{%block content8%}
The Sun is about 4.6 billion years old and is roughly middle-aged in its life cycle. It is expected to continue its current phase of stable hydrogen burning for several billion more years before evolving into a red giant.
{%endblock content8%}

{%block des2%} 
Understanding the Sun is crucial for scientists studying astrophysics, space weather, and the broader field of astronomy. The Sun's influence extends far beyond its immediate vicinity, shaping the dynamics and conditions of the entire solar system.
