Size and Composition
{%endblock head1%}
              
{%block content1%}
Saturn is a gas giant with a diameter of about 116,464 kilometers (72,366 miles), making it the second-largest planet in our solar system, after Jupiter. It is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of other elements.

Rings
{%endblock head2%}
              
{%block content2%}
Saturn's ring system is its most prominent feature. The rings are made up of countless particles, ranging in size from tiny specks to large boulders. They are primarily composed of water ice, with traces of rocky material. Saturn's ring system is divided into several main rings, labeled A, B, C, and other smaller divisions. The rings are a spectacular sight and are visible even in small telescopes from Earth.

Atmosphere
{%endblock head3%}
              
{%block content3%}
Saturn's atmosphere is characterized by bands of clouds and high-speed winds. Like Jupiter, Saturn exhibits a banded appearance, but its features are less pronounced. The atmosphere includes storms and features such as the hexagonal-shaped polar jet stream.

Moons
{%endblock head4%}
              
{%block content4%}
Saturn has a large number of moons, with over 80 known satellites. The largest moon, Titan, is the second-largest moon in the solar system and has a thick atmosphere. Other notable moons include Enceladus, known for its geysers of water vapor, and Mimas, which has a large crater resembling the Death Star from Star Wars.

Rotation and Day
{%endblock head5%}
              
{%block content5%}
Saturn has a rapid rotation, completing one full rotation on its axis in about 10.7 hours. Like Jupiter, its fast rotation contributes to an equatorial bulge

Space Missions
{%endblock head6%}
              
{%block content6%}
NASA's Cassini spacecraft, in collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Italian Space Agency, conducted an extensive study of Saturn and its moons. Cassini arrived at Saturn in 2004 and continued its mission until 2017, when it was intentionally directed into the planet's atmosphere to avoid contaminating moons that might harbor life.

Gravity and Mass
{%endblock head7%}
              
{%block content7%}
Saturn has a strong gravitational pull, about 10.44 m/sÂ² (meters per second squared), which is similar to Earth's moon. Despite its low density, Saturn's massive size gives it a significant mass.

Hexagon at the North Pole
{%endblock head8%}
              
{%block content8%}
Saturn's north pole features a hexagonal-shaped pattern in its cloud structure, a mysterious and unique atmospheric phenomenon. The exact cause of this hexagon is still not fully understood.
